# üß† AI Resume Match Analyzer

An intelligent web app that scores your resume against a job description using a hybrid AI model. It provides a detailed breakdown and personalized, AI-powered advice from Google's Gemini.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Weighted Scoring System:** Calculates a final match score based on three components:
    * **Content (Skills):** 50%
    * **Similarity (Context):** 30%
    * **Format (Structure):** 20%
* **AI-Powered Keyword Extraction:** Uses the **Google Gemini API** to analyze both the resume and job description, extracting the most relevant keywords, skills, and technologies like an expert recruiter.
* **Semantic Content Matching:** Instead of simple keyword counting, it uses a **SentenceTransformer** model to compare the *meaning* of the extracted keyword lists, giving credit for semantically similar skills (e.g., "ML" vs. "Machine Learning").
* **Contextual Similarity Matching:** Reads the *full text* of both documents to understand the overall "vibe" and contextual match, ensuring the resume's story aligns with the job's role.
* **ü§ñ AI Career Advisor:** Leverages the **Google Gemini API** to provide custom, actionable advice based on your specific score breakdown and missing skills.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (The "Brain")

This project uses a sophisticated hybrid approach to provide the most accurate analysis:

1.  **Input:** User uploads a resume (PDF) and pastes a job description.
2.  **Text Extraction:** `PyPDF2` reads and cleans the text from the PDF.
3.  **AI Keyword Extraction:** The app sends *both* texts to the **Gemini API** with a custom prompt, asking it to extract the top 30-40 most important keywords, skills, and tools.
4.  **Score Calculation:**
    * **Content Score (50%):** The `SentenceTransformer` model encodes the two *lists of Gemini-keywords* into vectors and calculates their cosine similarity. This measures how well the *core skills* match.
    * **Similarity Score (30%):** The `SentenceTransformer` model encodes the *full text* of the resume and JD into vectors and calculates their cosine similarity. This measures the *overall contextual* match.
    * **Format Score (20%):** A simple heuristic check (`re.search`) looks for key headers (e.g., "Experience", "Education", "Skills") and checks the document's length.
5.  **Final Report:** The three scores are combined using their weights to produce the final percentage.
6.  **AI Advice:** If requested, all this data (scores, missing keywords) is sent to the **Gemini API** for personalized improvement tips.
